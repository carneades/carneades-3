}

Welcome to the new website for the
[Carneades argumentation system](/Carneades).  The website is now
generated using the [Hugo Website Engine](http://hugo.spf13.com/) and
hosted on GitHub.  Hugo provides a nice, simple way to maintain a blog. We
will use this feature to make announcements about the Carneades.  The
blog is also available in the Atom syndication format
[here](/post/index.xml).
