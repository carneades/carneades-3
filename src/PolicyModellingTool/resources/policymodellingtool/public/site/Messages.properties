sct_intro=This is the opinion formation and polling tool. The tool serves two purposes:\
\n \
\n- It guides you step by step through the arguments on all sides of a complex policy debate, providing you with an overview of the issues, positions and arguments in a systematic way. The tool can help you to form your own opinion, if you dont yet have one, or to critically evaluate and reconsider your preexisting opinion, if you do. The tool also enables you to compare your responses with published positions of some stakeholders, such as the official positions of political parties. This can help you to find persons and organizations which best represent or share your views and interests. \
\n \
\n- At the same time the tool conducts a survey to collect your views and opinions on the issues, taking care to protect your privacy. The anonymous and aggregated results of the survey can provide valuable feedback to policy makers, going beyond the information provided by traditional surveys. It enables policy makers to discover not only how much support policies enjoy, but also to learn precisely why particular aspects of the policies, or their underlying assumptions, are supported or not. \

1. Log in using a pseudonym to protect your privacy. You can login again using this name to change your responses at any time. Choose  a cryptic name, like a secure password, to make it difficult for others to access or change your answers. (The system will generate a username for you, which you can use or change, as you prefer.) \
\n	\    
2. Read an introduction to the topic of the debate and select an issue of interest. \
\n \		
3. Answer a series of survey multiple-choice questions about the selected issue, asking you whether you agree or disagree with claims made in arguments. To help you to formulate or reconsider your opinion, you have the option to first view quotations of formulations of the arguments from the source documents. No information about the authors of the quotations will be shown during this phase, to allow the arguments to speak for themselves and avoid prejudicing your answers. (The authors will be revealed at the end, when comparing your opinions to theirs.) The system will inform you about your progress and estimate the remaining number of questions. The precise number of questions may vary, as the order and number of questions depends on your answers to prior questions. You decide how deep to delve into the issues and can control how much time to spend answering poll questions. \
\n \		
4. View a summary of the questions and your responses. You are provided with an opportunity to change your answers. \
\n \		
5. Compare your opinions with those of the authors of the source documents used to create the argument graph. Rank the authors of the source documents, such as political parties, by how much they agree or disagree with your opinions. You can click on the titles of the source documents to download and view their full text and check for yourself the extend to which your agree or disagree with the claims made.\
\n \
\nThis procedure is flexible and you are in control. You are the moderator of the virtual debate. You can stop at any time, and continue later if you'd like, or jump backwards or forwards to any step in the procedure.  \
