3. Double click on the carneades-webapp.jar file 
4. Alteratively, execute the following command line:

   $ java -jar carneades-webapp.jar

5. The server will be start and open the home page of the 
   Carneades client in your web browser.

6. If the home page fails to open, enter this URL into the 
   address bar of your web browser:
